# EC-5 Soil Moisture Sensor
The EC-5 is a soil moisture sensor used to detect the value of the **Volumetric Water Content**. 

## Powering the device
EC-20, EC-10 and EC-5 are intended only for use with dataloggers and readout devices which can provide short excitation pulses, leaving the sensors
turned off most of the time. If possible, connect the power in to a 2.5-3.6V pin that can source up to 10mA and use this pin to turn the sensor on/off.

## Collection of data
EC-5 sensors produce an analog voltage output proportional to the input voltage. For optimum performance, a 12 bit(or more) ADC should be used.
